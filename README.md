# Firewatch

An interactive homage to a game that wouldn’t fit in 1k. Save a forest from falling prey to a fire.

This demo was created for the [2016 JS1k competition](http://js1k.com/2016-elemental/) with the motto *Let’s get eleMental*.

## Controls

Arrow keys to move and space bar to discharge water.

## Compilation

Clone the repository and run the following commands

```
npm install
git clone https://github.com/Siorki/RegPack.git
cd RegPack/
npm install
cd ..
grunt
```

You'll find the compiled demo including the JS1k shim in `build/shim.html`.
